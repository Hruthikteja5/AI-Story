        <h1><center><u class="name">The Curse of the Dead Treasure</u></center></h1>

<u class="si">Chapter 1:</u> Calm Before the Storm<br>
Teja was a regular guy. A fan of adventures books, he lived a fairly simple life in the bustling city of Hyderabad. 
He spent his days working in a tech firm, his evenings at the gym, and weekends hanging out with his best friends. Life was easy,
predictable, and fun. His circle of friends was small but tight-knit:  
Raghav    – the brilliant techie who always had a solution to every problem.  
Vikram    – the thrill-seeker who loved adventure.  
Siddharth – the quiet, philosophical one who was always lost in a book.  
Ananya    – the logical thinker, often the voice of reason.  
Maya      – the free-spirited girl who was a friend of Teja’s since childhood.
        
But what was about to unfold would shatter their ordinary world. It all started when Teja received a package. It was an old woodenbox, 
sealed with an ancient-looking wax stamp. Inside, he found a mysterious map. The map was hand-drawn and looked centuries old. It 
seemed to lead to a place marked only as "The Dead Island". At first, Teja thought it was a prank—maybe some one pulling his leg.
But the more he studied the map, the more it intrigued him. The ancient symbols, the cryptic phrases, and the 
idea of a hidden treasure—it felt too real to ignore.
        
The map wasn’t the only clue. There was also a letter inside the box, written in a faded, elegant script:
        
"To those who seek the riches of the Dead Island:  
What you find will not be what you expect.  
Only the brave will survive, and even they will not escape the island unchanged.  
Beware the curse that guards the treasure.  
For the price of greed is always death."
        
Teja shared the letter and the map with his friends. They laughed it off at first, dismissing it as some elaborate hoax. But
when Siddharth, who had an interest in ancient civilizations, started deciphering the symbols, things began to change. The 
map was real—it pointed to an island that was believed to be cursed, located in the heart of the Pacific Ocean, off the 
coast of New Zealand.
        
“This isn’t just a treasure hunt,” Siddharth said, his voice low. “This island is shrouded in mystery. No one has ever come back from it. 
Some say it’s because the treasure is cursed.”
        
Teja felt a rush of excitement. This was the adventure he’d been dreaming about. The six of them decided to go after the treasure,
eager to prove the legend wrong, or perhaps, to prove it right. They booked their tickets and set off on what would be the most 
dangerous journey of their lives.
        
<u class="si">Chapter 2:</u> Into the Unknown<br>
After a long flight and a treacherous boat ride, they reached Mysteries Island—a place that no map would officially mark. The 
island was a place of shadows and secrets, shrouded by thick fog and towering cliffs. They landed on the shore, their hearts 
pounding in their chests. As they trekked into the dense jungle, the silence of the place weighed heavily on them. No birds, 
no animals—just an eerie stillness that seemed to pulse with danger.
        
They followed the map’s first clue:
        
"Where the waters meet the stone,  
Find the place where light is thrown.  
There you will see what was once lost,  
But you will pay a fearful cost."
        
It led them to an ancient temple, half-buried under centuries of overgrowth. Inside the temple, they found an inscription that warned:
        
"Only the worthy may enter.  
But first, you must face the test."
        
The entrance was blocked by a large stone door, and in front of it, a riddle was carved. The group stood there for hours, trying to 
figure it out. It was Raghav who cracked the code by using his knowledge of ancient languages.
        
"One must give before one can take." He read aloud. “It’s asking for a sacrifice.”
        
At first, they hesitated. The idea of a literal sacrifice seemed far-fetched, but after hours of deliberation, they realized they had 
no choice. The door opened, revealing a long, narrow passageway.
        
They stepped inside, unaware that the island was already testing them in ways they couldn’t understand. The air grew colder, and 
strange whispers echoed through the halls. 
        
<u class="si">Chapter 3:</u> The Mysterious Stranger<br>
As they explored deeper into the temple, they discovered strange markings on the walls—symbols they couldn’t decipher. Then, 
something even stranger happened. From the shadows, a figure appeared.
        
A girl—perhaps no older than 20—emerged from the darkened corner. She had long, dark hair and a mysterious aura. She looked
at them with piercing eyes and spoke in a voice that seemed both familiar and foreign.
        
"I’m not here to stop you,” she said cryptically. "I’ve been here before. Like you, I came seeking the treasure. But I’ve 
learned too much about this place. It will change you. You’ll never be the same."
        
Teja looked at her skeptically. "Who are you?"
        
The girl smiled faintly. "I’m Adira. And I’m here to warn you. You’re playing with forces beyond your control."
        
Adira explained that she had been on the island for months, studying its dark history and the treasure hidden within it.
She claimed that the treasure was not gold or jewels, but something far more dangerous—a force that could control minds, 
alter reality, and even bring the dead back to life.
        
The group, despite their fears, decided to press forward. Adira joined them, offering her knowledge of the island's dark secrets. 
The map had been leading them to the heart of the island, to a hidden crypt where the treasure was said to lie.
        
<u class="si">Chapter 4:</u> The Dead Treasure<br>
As they approached the final chamber, the ground trembled beneath their feet. They reached a vast underground vault, where a
massive stone door loomed ahead, covered in symbols that glowed faintly in the darkness.
        
Inside the vault, they found the Dead Treasure—an ornate, black chest, encrusted with strange gemstones. As Teja reached out 
to open it, the ground shook violently. Suddenly, a piercing scream echoed through the vault.
        
“No! You don’t understand!” Adira shouted, rushing forward. But it was too late.
        
The chest opened, and from within, a dark mist poured out, swirling around them. The treasure wasn’t gold—it was a cursed 
artifact that released a force of pure evil, capable of warping reality and raising the dead.
        
Teja, Raghav, Vikram, Ananya, and Siddharth fought to escape, but the island had already begun to shift. The ground split 
open, and ancient, undead warriors emerged from the depths, attacking them without mercy. In the chaos, Adira disappeared 
into the mist, her fate unknown.
        
<u class="si">Chapter 5:</u> The Sacrifice<br>
The group ran for their lives, barely escaping the island’s grasp. But the curse had already begun to take hold. Teja 
felt his vision blur, his mind clouded by the treasure’s power. He could hear whispers calling to him from 
the chest—promises of ultimate power.
        
In the end, it was Raghav who made the ultimate sacrifice. Realizing that the treasure could only be sealed by 
destroying it, he made the choice to stay behind. With a final look at his friends, he activated the device he 
had built—a bomb that would destroy the treasure and the curse with it.
        
The explosion rocked the island, and the mist dissipated. But as the group watched from a distance, they saw 
something chilling—Raghav’s face, his final expression frozen in time, staring back at them from the ruined temple.
        
Teja knew then that the curse of Mysteries Island had not been broken. The treasure was dead, but its power would 
live on in the memories of those who sought it—and in the lives it had claimed.
        
        
<u class="si">Chapter 6:</u> The Twist<br>
Back home, life tried to return to normal. But Teja couldn’t forget what had happened. The final message from Raghav
kept haunting him:
        
"The price of greed is always death."
        
And then, one night, Teja received a text from an unknown number. It was a picture—Raghav’s face, alive, standing in
front of the same treasure chest they had destroyed.
        
The dead, it seemed, had risen again.
